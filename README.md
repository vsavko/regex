# regex
Learning automata theory.

A small programme to find regular expressions within a file. It will convert a regular expression into an e-NFA, and then to DFA, which it will use to search the text.

The first argument of the program is the expression itself, the second one is the file location.

Regular expressions are using the following syntax:
'*' - kleene star
'+' - OR
'()' - brackets

The program is not finished yet.
